# Chaos Drop

Chaos Drop is a 2D reflex-based arcade game built in Unity to strengthen my understanding of gameplay systems, player feedback, and game state management.

The objective is simple:

Catch the good objects.  
Avoid the bad ones.  
Survive with 3 lives.

## Gameplay Features

- Smooth side-to-side player movement using Rigidbody physics  
- Dynamic tilt effect based on movement direction for added visual feedback  
- Three difficulty modes: Easy, Medium, Hard  
- Score system tied to object collection  
- Life system with visual heart indicators  
- Game Over state when all lives are lost  

---

## Feedback & Polish

To improve game feel and responsiveness:

- Particle effects on object interactions  
- Sound effects for collection and life loss  
- Movement-based rotation (player tilts toward movement direction)  
- Clean UI transitions between Menu, Gameplay, and Game Over  

---

## Systems Implemented

- Physics-based movement system  
- Collision detection using tags  
- Modular life management logic  
- Dynamic object spawning system  
- Difficulty scaling through spawn rate adjustment  
- Structured game states (Start Menu → Gameplay → Game Over)  

---

## Project Goal

This project was built to move beyond tutorials and apply core Unity concepts into a complete, playable experience.

Focus areas:
- Gameplay loop architecture  
- Player feedback systems  
- Clean state transitions  
- Structured and reusable C# scripting  

---

## Potential Improvements

- Object pooling for optimized spawning  
- Combo or multiplier scoring system  
- High score persistence  
- Additional visual polish
